        <p class="about-text">My last holiday was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic.
            I know Prague well because I lived there when I was at university, more than ten years ago.

            Instead of staying in a hotel, I stayed with one of my old friends.
            It was so much fun, and a little bit like my old life.
            I wanted to do all the same things I did in my university days,
            so I visited the university. It has changed a lot and looks more modern.
            I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods.
            I was really happy to find my favourite cheese and chocolate biscuits but they were a bit more expensive
            than I remember!

            We did some touristy things too. We walked up beautiful Petrin Hill and around the castle.
            The views of the city are amazing up there. We walked across the historic Charles Bridge.
            My friend's flat is very near the TV Tower so we saw the famous baby statues climbing up it.
            Those things haven't changed, of course.
