                exactly what happened somewhere between 1700-1760 CE. And that's why both Christians and Kolis visit

                belonged to Shri
                Revashankar Jagjeevan Jhaveri, who was Gandhi's friend and a host during that period. It was from Mani
                Bhavan that

                Hindu-Muslim Unity. In
                1955 the building was dedicated as a memorial to Gandhiji and to the very important activities of great

                Unlike other temples, this one is dedicated to a goddess of particular communities and not the entire
                religion. Goddess Mumba is the patron goddess of the Somavanshi Kshatriya, Koli and Agri communities
                residing in Maharashtra. According to the legends of this community, Goddess Mumba is a powerful
                guardian and an incarnation of Goddess Parvati.

                Located on the Bhuleshwar Road, the temple was first opened in the year 1675 and has been relocated once
                to its current place. Inside the temple, you will find the statue of the deity which is made of black
                stone with an orange face. While the statue itself doesn't have a mouth to symbolize earth and is simple
                and beautiful, the entire altar on which it stands is decorated by the devotees.

                Since Tuesday is of utmost importance in Hindu mythology, be ready to face a lot of crowd if you
                visiting on this particular day of the week. The rush is fine on the other days.
