                Pune is a sprawling city in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. It was once the base of the Peshwas
                (prime ministers) of the Maratha Empire, which lasted from 1674 to 1818. It's known for the grand Aga
                Khan Palace, built in 1892 and now a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, whose ashes are preserved in the
                garden. The 8th-century Pataleshwar Cave Temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.
            </p>


            <p class="information-about-city">
                Pune at different points in time has been ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty, Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the
                Mughals, and the Adil Shahi dynasty. In the 18th century, the city was part of the Maratha Empire, and
                the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire.[27] Many historical landmarks like
                Pataleshwar caves, Shaniwarwada, Shinde Chhatri, and Vishrambaug Wada date to this era. Historical sites
                from different eras are dotted across the city.

            Aga Khan Palace is sure to appear among the top names, and for a good reason. The palace is a testament to
            glorious architecture and will offer you a stunning visual treat. Built in the 19th century, the spectacular
            palace stands on sprawling lawns and boasts of five halls. Huge hallways and Italian arches feature
            throughout the structure. Apart from its structural beauty, there’s one more reason that firmly establishes
            this palace's position among the historical places of Pune. The palace was used as a prison to lock up
            Mahatma Gandhi and other patriotic leaders during the country’s freedom struggle.

            marble floors, and glass chandeliers, the magnificent complex of Shaniwar Wada stands as an iconic structure

            Lal Mahal is one of the landmark monuments of Pune, constructed by Shahaji Bhosale, the father of Shivaji,
            for his wife and son. The original structure was built in 1630, but after its destruction, it was rebuilt in
            1988. The place holds much historical significance as Shivaji had spent almost a decade of his childhood
            here. Made of red bricks, this beautiful edifice exudes a matchless charm that has turned it into a tourist
            hotspot in Pune.

            <p class="place-info">
                Unlike other temples, this one is dedicated to a goddess of particular communities and not the entire
                religion. Goddess Mumba is the patron goddess of the Somavanshi Kshatriya, Koli and Agri communities
                residing in Maharashtra. According to the legends of this community, Goddess Mumba is a powerful
                guardian and an incarnation of Goddess Parvati.

            <p class="place-info">
                Located on the Bhuleshwar Road, the temple was first opened in the year 1675 and has been relocated once
                to its current place. Inside the temple, you will find the statue of the deity which is made of black
                stone with an orange face. While the statue itself doesn't have a mouth to symbolize earth and is simple
                and beautiful, the entire altar on which it stands is decorated by the devotees.

            <p class="place-info">
                Since Tuesday is of utmost importance in Hindu mythology, be ready to face a lot of crowd if you

            <p class="place-info">
                Each idol of the different deities is ethereal and carved out of stone. People say that all the statues
                are 'swayambhu' which means they have been carved in the most realistic form of the goddess herself.
                Each goddess is adorned with a golden mask as well and bathed every morning.

                Bhendi Bazaar is home to some of Mumbai's best street food places. The best time to visit Mohammad Ali
                road
                (where Noor Mohmaddi is, along with many other great restaurants and roadside Kabab joints) is during
                Ramadan. This is when you can actually spot Bollywood stars roaming the streets and tasting the
                yumminess
                beside you. But you're going to be too busy with your face in the plate to notice them.
